I created a music player in swift. It has a song list of 57 songs and two options. It can shuffle songs and also auto play music. 
Update: 4/5/2017 The genre option has been made. The playlist is now one-hundred and thirteen songs and growing. There is a growing realization that in order to compete with iTunes the user must be able to add their own songs. In order to do this we will use Google Firebase. The repository must be able to add MP3 files and write to the actual playlist library. Feel free to help out with this project and push your code# MusicPlayerIOS
